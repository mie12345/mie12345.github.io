                <p>Follow an iterative prototyping process: rather than trying to get everything perfect right out of the gate, we try to use techniques that allow us to fail fast and learn from our mistakes. We design multiple versions of the product, each time getting better and better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Apply user centered research and design methods: a whole set of these will work to keep the design on track and make sure that we’re designing something that’s going to end up delivering a good user experience in the end.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Understand a bit about human behavior: it is helpful to know a little bit about how people work. And what we know will help them accomplish what they need to accomplish.

                    <br>
                    Apply common sense: by following an iterative prototyping process that user-centered research and design methods and knowing a bit about human behavior, we’re in a much better position to use our own common sense to make good decisions
